In a somewhat monopolistic setup, OpenAI can reach escape velocity simply by leveraging economies of scale and an integrative approach. Through their distribution turbocharged by Microsoft, they can continue to lock in the users by providing the best models with the best availability and price. Locking in users means they can continue RLHF'ing at scale and might be able to tap into new or hard-to-access data to continue producing the best models that, in turn, further lock in the users. Integrative not only means going upstream in the stack but also moving downstream into the tooling layer - simply put - if you are using models mainly from one provider anyway, why not also use the tooling built by said provider and optimized for those models? Despite OpenAI playing the friendly platform and ecosystem guy, they have shown to fiercely expand across their value chain by going more agentic, bundling in data ingestion, and broader RAG functionalities. The low-hanging fruit capabilities that tooling startups want to capture will be eaten up by anything on OpenAI's product roadmap or handed off to Microsoft for the last-mile logistics."

Most large enterprises are still trying to analytically sort what \"AI\" means for them, and are still many quarters from embracing this new technology.\""
